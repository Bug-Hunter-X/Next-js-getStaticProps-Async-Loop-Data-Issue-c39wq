# Next.js getStaticProps Async Loop Data Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using `getStaticProps` or `getStaticPaths` in Next.js to fetch data asynchronously within a loop.  The problem arises when the asynchronous operations don't complete before the `getStaticProps` function returns, resulting in incomplete data being passed to the page.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file shows an example where an array of product IDs is processed, fetching data for each ID asynchronously. Due to the improper handling of async operations within the loop, the `products` array might not be fully populated before `getStaticProps` finishes, causing the page to render with missing product data.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach.  It uses `Promise.all` to ensure all asynchronous operations complete before the `getStaticProps` function returns, thereby preventing incomplete data.
